These scripts are designed to use the Berg and Coop method to evaluate polygenic selection.

Data: Directory of data to evaluate
      -Maize282 panel GBS (partially imputed) (downloaded from Panzea 6/25/14)
      - Highland/Lowland GBS (downloaded from Github 6/25/14)

Scripts: Directory of scripts
	 -isolateSamples.R: When multiple GBS runs of the same accession exist,
	 		    this script will remove the run with less data.
	 -mergeSNPs.R: merge 282 data with highlow data, on SNPs
	 -population_structure.R: Evaluate population structure on high/low
	 			  populations and ames population. Project
				  high/low population structure onto Ames PCA
				  and evaluate variance along each PC.
